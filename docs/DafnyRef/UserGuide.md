# 26. Dafny User's Guide {#sec-user-guide}

Most of this document decribes the Dafny programming language.
This section describes the `dafny` tool, a combined verifier and compiler
that implements the Dafny language.

The development of the dafny language and tool is a GitHub project at [https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny).
The project is open source, with collaborators from various organizations and additional contributors welcome.
The software itself is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## 26.1. Introduction

The dafny tool implements the following capabilities:

- checking that the input files represent a valid Dafny program (i.e., syntax, grammar and type checking);
- verifying that the program meets its specifications, by translating the program to verification conditions
and checking those with Boogie and an SMT solver, typically Z3;
- compiling the program to a target language, such as C#, Java, Javascript, Go (and others in development);
- running the executable produced by the compiler.

Using various command-line flags, the tool can perform various combinations of the last three actions (the first
action is always performed).

## 26.2. Dafny Programs and Files

A Dafny program is a set of modules.
Modules can refer to other modules, such as through `import` declarations
or `refines` clauses.
A Dafny program consists of all the modules needed so that all module
references are resolved.

Dafny files (`.dfy`) in the operating system each hold
some number of top-level declarations. Thus a full program may be
distributed among multiple files.
To apply the `dafny` tool to a Dafny program, the `dafny` tool must be
given all the files making up a complete program (or, possibly, more than
one program at a time). This can be effected either by listing all of the files
by name on the command-line or by using `include` directives within a file
to stipulate what other files contain modules that the given file needs.
Thus the complete set of modules are all the modules in all the files listed
on the command-line or referenced, recursively, by `include` directives
within those files. It does not matter if files are repeated either as
includes or on the command-line.[^fn-duplicate-files]

Note however that although the complete set of files, command-line plus
included files, make up the program, by default, only those files listed on
the command-line are verified. To do a complete verification, each file
must be verified; it may well happen that a verification failure in one
file (which is not on the command-line and thus not checked) may hide a
verification failure in a file that is being checked.
Thus it is important to eventually check all files, preferably in an order
in which the files without dependences are checked first, then those that
depend on them, etc., until all files are checked.

[^fn-duplicate-files]: File names are considered equal if they
have the same absolute path, compared as case-sensitive strings
(regardless of whether the underlying file-system is case sensitive).
Use of symbolic links
may make the same file have a different absolute path; this will generally
cause duplicate declaration errors.

## 26.3. Installing Dafny From Binaries

Current and past Dafny binary releases can be found at
[https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases) for each supported platform.
Each release is a .zip file with a name combining the release name and the
platform. For convenience we will call that zip file `Dafny.zip`, though the
names generally are something like `dafny-3.0.0-pre-1-x64-ubuntu-16.04.zip`.

### 26.3.1. Windows
To install Dafny on your own machine, download `Dafny.zip` and
**save** it to your disk. Then, before you open or unzip it, right-click
on it and select Properties; at the bottom of the dialog, click the
Unblock button and then the OK button. Now, open `Dafny.zip` and copy its
contents into a clean, new directory (called `$DAFNY` subsequently)
on your machine. (You can now delete the
`Dafny.zip` file.)

Then: To run Dafny from the command line, simply run `dafny` from the
    `$DAFNY/dafny/Binaries` directory.

### 26.3.2. Linux and Mac
Make sure you have Mono version 4. Then save the
contents of the `Dafny.zip` for the appropriate version of your platform.
You can now run Dafny from the command line by invoking the script file
`$DAFNY/dafny/Binaries/dafny`.

### 26.3.3. Mac using brew
 On a Mac, you can install `dafny`, along with its dependencies,  using the `brew` package manager.
If `brew` is installed, simply issue the command `brew install dafny`.
The tool is executed as `$DAFNY/dafny/Binaries/dafny`.

## 26.4. Building Dafny from Source

### 26.4.1. Dependencies

TO BE WRITTEN

The current version of the Dafny executable builds and runs with Visual Studio 2012 or later.

### 26.4.2. Installing the source code

The source code is available from github, by cloning the repository:

* create a new directory of your choice (here called $DAFNY)
* make it the current working directory (i.e., `cd` to it)
* Issue the command `git clone https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny.git`

### 26.4.3. Building the source code

TO BE WRITTEN

### 26.4.4. Running the executable

After a successful build, the executable to run is

* `$DAFNY/dafny/Binaries/dafny.exe` on windows and
* `$DAFNY/dafny/Binaries/dafny` on linux-like and mac platforms.

### 26.4.5. Running tests

To install lit (for test run):
    -   first, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    -   second, install [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/)
    -   last, run "pip install lit" and "pip install OutputCheck"

Then, to run all the tests,

* `lit $DAFNY/dafny/Test`

The argument to the `lit` command can be any number of .dfy files or folders
containing .dfy files (all of which must be under the `Test` directory).

## 26.5. Dafny Code Style

There are code style conventions for Dafny code, recorded [here](https://dafny-lang.github.io/dafny/StyleGuide/Style-Guide).
Most significantly, code is written without tabs and with a 2 space indentation.


## 26.6. IDEs for Dafny

Dafny source files are text files and can of course be edited with any
text editor. However, some tools provide syntax-aware features:

- There is a [Dafny mode for
    Emacs](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie-friends).

- VSCode, a cross-platform editor for many programming languages has an extension for dafny, installed from within VSCode. VSCode is available [her](http://code.visualstudio.com). The extension provides syntax highlighting, in-line parser, type and verification errors, and code navigation.

- An old Visual Studio plugin is no longer supported

<!--
To test your installation, you can open Dafny test files
from the dafny/Test subdirectory in Visual Studio 2012.
You will want to use "VIEW/Error List" to ensure that
you see any errors that Dafny detects, and
"VIEW/Output" to see the result of any compilation.

An example of a valid Dafny test is

```
dafny/Test/vstte2012/Tree.dfy
```

You can choose "Dafny/Compile" to compile the Dafny
program to C\#. Doing that for the above test
produces `Tree.cs` and `Tree.dll` (since this test does
not have a main program).

The following file in the Dafny repository:

```
dafny\Test\dafny0\Array.dfy
```

is an example of a Dafny file with verification errors.
The source will show red squiggles or dots where there
are errors, and the Error List window will describe the
errors.

## 26.7. The Dafny Server

TO BE WRITTEN

## 26.8. Using Dafny From the Command Line

`dafny` is a conventional command-line tool, operating just like other
command-line tools in Windows and Unix-like systems.


- The format of a command-line is determined by the shell program that is executing the command-line (.e.g. bash, the windows shell, COMMAND, etc.). The command-line typically consists of file names and options, in any order, separated by spaces.
- Files are designated by absolute paths or paths relative to the current
working directory. A command-line argument not matching a known option is considered a filepath.
- Files containing dafny code must have a `.dfy` suffix.
- There must be at least one `.dfy` file.
- The command-line may contain other kinds of files appropriate to
the language that the dafny files are being compiled to.

The command `Dafny.exe /?` gives the current set of options supported
by the tool. The most commonly used options are described in [Section 26.11](#sec-command-line-options).

- Options may begin with either a `/` (as is typical on Windows) or a `-` (as is typical on Linux)
- If an option is repeated (e.g., with a different argument), then the later instance on the command-line supercedes the earlier instance.
- If an option takes an argument, the option name is followed by a `:` and then by the argument value, with no
intervening white space; if the argument itself contains white space, the argument must be enclosed in quotes.
- Escape characters are determined by the shell executing the command-line.

The dafny tool performs several tasks:

- Checking the form of the text in a `.dfy` file. This step is always performed, unless the tool is simply asked for
help information or version number.
- Running the verification engine to check all implicit and explicit specifications. This step is performed by
default, but can be skipped by using the `-noVerify` or `-dafnyVerify:0` option
- Compiling the dafny program to a target language. This step is performed by default if the verification is
successful but can be skipped or always executed by using variations of the `-compile` option.
- Whether the source code of the compiled target is written out is controlled by `-spillTargetCode`
- The particular target language used is chosen by `-compileTarget`
- Whether or not the dafny tool attempts to run the compiled code is controlled by `-compile`

The dafny tool terminates with these exit codes:

* 0 -- success
* 1 -- invalid command-line arguments
* 2 -- parse or types errors
* 3 -- compilation errors
* 4 -- verification errors

Errors in earlier phases of processing typically hide later errors.
For example, if a program has parsing errors, verification or compilation will
not be attempted.
The option `-countVerificationErrors:0` forces the tool to always end with a 0
exit code.

## 26.9. Verification

There are a great many options that control various aspects of verifying dafny programs. Here we mention only a few:

- Control of output: `-dprint`, `-rprint`, `-stats`, `-compileVerbose`
- Whether to print warnings: `-proverWarnings`
- Control of time: `-timeLimit`
- Control of the prover used: `-prover`

TO BE WRITTEN - advice on use of verifier, debugging verification problems

## 26.10. Compilation {#sec-compilation}

The `dafny` tool can compile a Dafny program to one of several target languages. Details and idiosyncracies of each
of these are described in the following subsections. In general note that,

- the compiled code originating from `dafny` can be compiled with other source and binary code, but only the `dafny`-originated code is verified
- the output file names can be set using `-out`
- for each target language, there is a runtime library that must be used with the `dafny`-generated code when executing that code; the runtime libraries are
part of the Binary and Source releases (typically in the Binaries folder)
- names in Dafny are written out as names in the target language. In some cases this can result in naming conflicts.
Thus if a Dafny program is intended to be compiled to a target language X, you should avoid using Dafny identifiers
that are not legal identifiers in X or that conflict with reserved words in X.


TODO - location of DafnyRuntime files

### 26.10.1. Main method

To generate a stand-alone executable from a Dafny program, the
Dafny program must contain exactly one method named `Main`, with no input arguments.
This `Main` method is the entry point for the program.
Without a `Main` method, `dafny` will still produce executable output files, but
they will need to be linked with some other code in the target language that
provides a `main` entry point.

### 26.10.4. Java

The Dafny-to-Java compiler writes out the translated files of a file _A_`.dfy`
to a directory _A_-java. The `-out` option can be used to choose a 
different output directory. The file _A_`.dfy` is translated to _A_`.java`,
which is placed in the output directory along with helper files.
If more than one `.dfy` file is listyed on the command-line, then the output
directory name is taken from the first file, and `.java` files are written
for each of the `.dfy` files.

## 26.11. Dafny Command Line Options {#sec-command-line-options}

There are many command-line options to the `dafny` tool.
The most current documentation of the options is within the tool itself,
using the `/?` option.
Here we give an expanded description of the most important options.

Remember that options can be stated with either a leading `/` or a leading `-`.
